# odin-recipes
All my projects from TOP. 

So far,  I have learned to make a repo, and clone it to my local PC.
Itâ€™s time to put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
