  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Good quality thick yoghurt</li>
    <li>A thermometer</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The starter yoghurt you use matters. Pick a good quality thick one. You only need a small one</li>
    <li>Keep things clean. Make sure you sterilise your tools.</li>
    <li>Have a good cooler box or put the wrapped pot in the oven with just the light on (This is according to my mama and I trust her</li>
    <li>heese cloth or a clean pillow cover (again thanks for the tip mum), great to strain the yoghurt to remove the excess whey. Please don't throw the whey. It's perfect in cakes, mocktails or even to help preserve condiments you make...but that's a video for another day</li>
    <li>Cook the milk while constantly stirring until it gets to 85ºc (185ºf) then cool to 45ºc (113ºf). Add the culture once the milk cools to 45ºc(113ºf)</li>
